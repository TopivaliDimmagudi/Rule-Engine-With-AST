#  This is my First Java Project using Maven Tool

Rule Engine with AST :
This project implements a simple 3-tier rule engine in Java that determines user eligibility based on attributes such as age, department, income, and experience. It utilizes an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent conditional rules, allowing for dynamic creation, combination, and modification of these rules.

Features :
AST Representation: Define and manipulate rules using an efficient AST structure.
Rule Creation: Create rules from string representations with validation for attributes and comparisons.
Rule Combination: Combine multiple rules into a single AST to evaluate complex eligibility criteria.
Rule Evaluation: Evaluate user data against rules to determine eligibility.
Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling for invalid rule strings and attribute validations.
Rule Modification: Modify existing rules by changing operators or operand values.
User-Defined Functions: Support for simple user-defined functions within the rule language (basic implementation).
Technologies used:
Java and JSON
